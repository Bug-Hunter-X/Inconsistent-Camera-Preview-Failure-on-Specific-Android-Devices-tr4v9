# Inconsistent Camera Preview Failure on Specific Android Devices

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview fails to render, leaving a blank screen.  The issue is inconsistent and difficult to debug due to the lack of clear error messages. The bug appears related to resource management or hardware conflicts on specific Android devices.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on a physical Android device (specific devices may be affected).
3. Observe whether the camera preview renders correctly. The preview may work on some devices but fail on others, exhibiting inconsistent behavior.

## Potential Causes

* **Resource Management Issues:** The issue could be related to memory management or system resource constraints on particular Android devices.
* **Hardware Conflicts:**  It is possible that the issue stems from conflicts between the Expo Camera implementation and the specific hardware configuration of the Android device.
* **Android System Version Compatibility:** The bug could manifest on specific versions of the Android OS.
