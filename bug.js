This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with specific Android devices. The camera preview fails to render, resulting in a blank screen. This happens inconsistently, only on certain devices and under particular conditions.  The error is not immediately apparent in the logs, making debugging difficult.  The issue seems related to the interaction between Expo's camera implementation and underlying Android system resources, possibly related to memory management or camera hardware conflicts. It's not reproducible on iOS or emulators.
